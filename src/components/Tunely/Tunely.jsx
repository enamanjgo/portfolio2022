              From anecdotal experience, finding new music is a task with more
              resistance than necessary. Scrolling through music app
              recommendations only to try and ‚Äúskip to the good part‚Äù is
              time-consuming and sometimes a little bit boring. For Hack the
              North 2021, our team sought out to ideate a product that could
              streamline the process of finding new music and sharing it with
              friends.{' '}

              To better understand our userbase, we investigated Spotify. As
              everyday users, we identified a typical flow for discovering new

              Analyzing the above user stories, we compiled a list of pain
