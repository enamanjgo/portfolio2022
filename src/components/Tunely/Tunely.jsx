              From anecdotal experience, finding new music is a task with more
              resistance than necessary. Scrolling through music app
              recommendations only to try and ‚Äúskip to the good part‚Äù is
              time-consuming and sometimes a little bit boring. For Hack the
              North 2021, our team sought out to ideate a product that could
              streamline the process of finding new music and sharing it with

             In the case of this hackathon, the developers on our team were interested in implementing a swiping interface inspired by Tinder. 
             However, in a more general case, it would be more important to approach solving the user problem (inefficiency in finding and 
             sharing music) in an unbiased way. For example, it is possible that an entirely new application would not be necessary to address the problem, 
             and it could be useful to look into solutions that integrate into existing music platforms.
